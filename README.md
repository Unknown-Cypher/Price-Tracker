 # A Ecom Price Tracking Application


## Introduction

Developed using Next.js and Bright Data's webunlocker, this e-commerce product scraping site is designed to assist users in making informed decisions. It notifies users when a product drops in price and helps competitors by alerting them when the product is out of stock, all managed through cron jobs.
